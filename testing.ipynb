    "Initial ERD Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussed Business Problem :\n",
    "\n",
    "A Flight Booking System will keep a track and maintain booking of records efficiently and safely.\n",
    "Booking details should be easily recoverable and retrievable from the database.\n",
    "Airlines need to constantly process bookings from expectant passengers, they need a means of keeping on top of everything. Therefore, storing the records of flight schedules and passenger details will keep the data organized.\n",
    "The automated flight booking system will allow only authorized users to access the information.\n",
    "The system reduces redundancy by maintaining a centralized database and storing all information only once.\n",
    "Entities Present:\n",
    "\n",
    "Airport\n",
    "Passenger\n",
    "Flight_Details\n",
    "Flight_Service\n",
    "Seat_Details\n",
    "Flight_Cost\n",
    "Reservation\n",
    "Travel_Class\n",
    "Calendar\n",
    "Payment\n",
    "Payment_Status\n",
    "Service_Offering\n",
    "Relationships between entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "An airport manages multiple flights. An airport may or may not have a flight landing/takeoff. Hence, it’s optional. Whereas for flight details, it is mandatory to have one airport association.\n",
    "A flight may offer multiple services and each service may be offered to many flights.\n",
    "A flight comprises multiple seats. It is mandatory that the flight consists of a seat. For Seat details to exist, it is mandatory that it is linked to at least one flight.\n",
    "A passenger can make multiple reservations for a flight. Passengers may or may not reserve a flight. However, it is mandatory that reservation has to be associated with only one passenger.\n",
    "Reservation confirms the Seat Details. It is mandatory that a reservation is linked with a Seat. A seat may or may not be linked with a reservation. One seat can only be linked to one reservation.\n",
    "A travel class should consist of multiple seats. A seat should be linked to only one travel class.\n",
    "A Payment may consist of multiple payment status. Whereas, a payment status should have a Payment associated with it.\n",
    "A Payment Status should have a Reservation. A reservation may consist of multiple payment status.\n",
    "The Flight cost should be determined from the Calendar.\n",
    "The Seat Details should be associated with a Flight cost. The Flight Cost is calculated based on the Seat Details.\n",
    "Key Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Airport can have multiple flight details associated with its respective source and destination.\n",
    "Each Flight may offer many flight services like Food Service, Entertainment Service, Wifi Service etc. Each Flight_Service may be offered to many flights. Service_Offering is an associative entity which stores Service_ID and Flight_ID.\n",
    "Each Flight mandatorily comprises one or many seats and each seat is associated with a particular Travel_Class_ID. A seat can belong to Business class or economy class etc.\n",
    "Each passenger may or may not make multiple reservations. If a passenger makes a reservation, a seat of the passenger’s choice will be assigned. The Seat_Details will point to Travel_Class and Flight_Details. For each seat reserved, a passenger may or may not pay to confirm the seat. A passenger can reserve one seat per Reservation_ID.\n",
    "Payment_Status is an associative entity which holds the information related to particular Reservation_ID and Payment_ID.\n",
    "If the passenger has or hasn’t done the payment it will reflect in payment status and the respective payment due date and amount will be stored in Payment.\n",
    "Flight_Cost can be determined on the basis of Seat_Details and Calendar from which a particular seat belongs to a travel class and the date when the seat is booked respectively.\n",
    "Final ERD Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "This intial ER Diagram can be improved by removing redundancies and refining the entities\n",
    "\n",
    "· Airport entity has AirportCity and AirportCountry which provides the airport specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "· Flight_Type attribute has been added to Flight_Details\n",
    "\n",
    "· Payment entity has been removed from the ER diagram and its attributes have been listed under Payment_Status.\n",
    "\n",
    "· The cardinality between Payment_Status and Reservation has been made optional one to mandatory many. Therefore, Reservation_ID becomes foreign key inside Payment_Status.\n",
    "\n",
    "· Service_Offering which is an associative entity has 3 new attributes called Offered_YN , From_Date and To_Date. From_Date and To_Date that would give us the period when certain flight services are provided. Offered_YN would tell us if that service is been offered to a particular travel class.\n",
    "\n",
    "· From the previous ER Diagram, we have removed Service_Type from Flight_Service and Class_Type from Travel_Class as it’s not required to enhance it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
